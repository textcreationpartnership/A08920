            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YR, it was my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe when I firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke to tranſlate theſe diuine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Meditations on the Lords Paſſion, and Motiues to Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, (ſelected out of the workes of S. BERNARD, and other auncient Writers, not verbally turned into Engliſh, but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with ſuch other Meditations, as it pleaſed God to infuſe into my minde) to haue dedicated them vnto your worthy Father, who (both in reſpect of his neere alliance, and other reaſons of moment)
<pb facs="tcp:19321:3"/> might by his owne right haue challenged that duty at my hands.</p>
                  <p>But ſince it ſeemed good vnto the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie, to remoue him from earth, out of the ſocietie of mortall men, to liue for euer in the company of the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heauen, before I could attaine to the accompliſhment of my wiſhed deſires: I could finde none more neere and deere vnto me then your ſelf, who might vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to giue the firſt kinde entertainement to my well-intended labours, when they ſhould come forth into the light. For as the Lord hath bleſſed you with a peaceable fruition of your Fathers poſſeſſions: ſo no doubt you are alſo a true heire of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Vertues.</p>
                  <p>My deſire is to profit all, yet I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by many priuate reſpects, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my labours, (ſuch as they are) in a more ſpeciall manner vnto your ſelfe, that thereby I might ſeale vnto you, a true aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of my gratefull affection towards you, For farre be it from my thought, that eyther I ſhould forget your kind ſpeeches, or bury your good deed in the darke graue of Obliuion, expreſſed to mee, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded towards mee at my laſt conference with you.</p>
                  <p>I know you cannot but kindely accept my ſmall mite, if you ballance it with the
<pb facs="tcp:19321:3"/> willingneſſe of my minde: and I am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you will not miſlike it, in regard of the matter, though happily you may finde ſome diſtaſte in reſpect of the ſtile. For what can be more fit for theſe times, then Motiues to Mortification? or more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the ſoule of a ſorrowfull ſinner, then a ſerious Meditation of the bitter Paſſion of our Crucified Redeemer, <hi>who being God, became man for our ſakes: ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a moſt cruell death on the Croſſe for our ſinnes: and being buried, roſe againe for our iuſtification?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is not my purpoſe heere to relate what ſweet ſtreames doe flow from this chriſtall and pure Fountaine, what whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fruits may be gathered from this fruitfull Tree, or what rich Treaſure may be found in this golden Mine. I deſire to containe my lines within the bounds of Mediocritie: eſpecially when the Current of my words turneth towards One whom God hath bleſſed with capacitie, able to conceiue the great commodities which doe proceed from ſuch Chriſtian exerciſes: Yet before I make a full period, giue mee leaue (I pray you) to let you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that I haue much endeauoured, ſo to expreſſe the grieuous Paſsion of our gracious Redeemer, as if it were now in preſent action before our eyes, that I might
<pb facs="tcp:19321:4"/> the better ſtirre vp feruent motions of Pietie in the minde, and kindle the ſparkes of true deuotion in the heart of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For indeed, the full ſcope of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, to glorifie GOD, and benefit my brethren. And that your owne ſoule, (as alſo the ſoule of euery religious Reader,) may be the more neerely and deepely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and wounded with a feeling conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our Sauiours death, I ſuppoſe it the beſt way, after a due preparation thereunto by prayer (without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſanctified vnto vs,) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne at the firſt Meditation, and ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Hiſtory of his Paſsion before you, to proceed vntill you come vnto the yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of his Ghoſt vpon the Croſſe.</p>
                  <p>In the progreſſe whereof, it may pleaſe God ſo to touch your heart with ſorrow, that your eyes, (with thoſe in the Goſpell, who came to ſee his death, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.48.) may guſh forth Teares for griefe, that ſo innocent a Lambe ſhould be ſo deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and cruelly tortured, tormented, and crucified. Where alſo you (in whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I ſpeake vnto all) may iuſtly conceiue a double griefe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> (the Righteous,) was killed for ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that hee was killed for our ſinne.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19321:4"/>
                  <p>The conſideration whereof, ſhould moue all, with weeping <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22.62. to ſhed ſalt and briniſh teares of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in remembrance of our offences, that being therewith pricked at the heart, Chriſt Ieſus may ſay vnto our ſorrowfull ſoules, as ſometimes he did vnto the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, <hi>I haue heard your groaning, and will haue compaſſion on you,</hi> Iudg 2.18. And may alſo thereunto adde, <hi>Sonne, be of good cheere, thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee,</hi> Matth. 9 2. <hi>Come hither and taſte how ſweet I thy Lord am: with mee there is plenteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as in matter of ſorrow, it more deepely pierceth the ſoule of the hearer with griefe, or in matter of delight, more affecteth the minde with ioy, to heare the particular relation of ſome Tragical euent, or the parts and particles of ſome delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full accident reported, then onely to heare a bare narration of either in groſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſsing the parts thereof: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it cannot chuſe, but more deepely wound the ſoule of euery Chriſtian, to heare, or read, the ſpeciall and ſeuerall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt in his Paſsion, then if it were onely ſayd thus, <hi>Chriſt died for vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But leaſt I draw my lines beyond the limits of due meaſure, I heere conclude: deſiring the LORD to bleſſe you, and
<pb facs="tcp:19321:5"/> the reſt of your Fathers iſſue, with many happy dayes vpon earth, and when they are ended heere in peace, to receiue you all into his heauenly Kingdome of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Glory.</p>

Oh wonderfull Supper, in which ſo many admirable things were done and effected!

                     <p>I know therefore (my gratious Lord) who, and what a one I

                     <p>AFter our moſt louing and moſt gracious Ieſus had fed his Diſciples with his precious Bodie, and refreſhed them with his Bloud, hee was troubled in ſpirit, and ſaid to his Diſciples: <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily, I ſay vnto you, that one of you ſhall betray mee, which eateth with mee, that the Scripture may be

Oh how harſh and bitter meats hadſt thou reſerued for thy Diſciples, at the end of thy Supper? Thou didſt feede them with ſweet milke in the beginning, and thou gaueſt them delicious honie in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, when thou didſt waſh their feete; and refreſhedſt them with thy precious body for their meate, and with thy roiall bloud for their drinke.</p>
                     <p>But now in the end thou hadſt reſerued <hi>gall</hi> and <hi>Wormwood,</hi> ſowre ſauce for their ſweet meate, when theſe ſorrowfull words did paſſe out of thy bleſſed lips, and that dreadfull ſpeech was vttered, by thy honie-flowing mouth.</p>
                     <p>Woe is me (my ſweet and louing Ieſus) I ſeeme to ſee the cheerefull countenance of thy deare diſciples
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19321:35"/> ſodainely changed, their hearts ouer-whelmed with floods of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, their mindes perplexed with exceſſiue griefe, the heate of their deſires quite extinguiſhed, and all their hopes whollie daſhed ſo ſoone as thoſe fearefull words had paſſed through their eares, and pierced their hearts; who of ſo ſweet a beginning, little expected ſo ſowre a concluſion.</p>
                     <p>Had they not much matter of mourning, and was it not a world of ſorrow vnto them, that thou being their Maſter, Captaine, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, Gardian, and Ruler, ſhouldſt be betraied to death? and it did much more augment the matter of their woe, and increaſe the heapes of their griefe, that one of them ſhould contriue this horrible Treaſon, and be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this bloudie attempt.</p>
                     <p>The firſt was a violent motiue, to moue them to exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,

But heare oh my ſoule, what his faithfull Diſciples anſwered, when they heard thoſe lamentable words pronounced. <hi>They looked one vpon another, their faces being pale with feare,</hi> and their hearts full fraughted with ſorrow, and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could their tongues vtter any

Who amongſt vs ſhall proue ſuch a curſed wretch, as once to imagine or ſuch a horrible traitor as once to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot ſuch a deteſtable deede and execrable fact?</p>
                     <p>Such a hainous intention, ſaid euery one of them, was farre from my thoughts, ſuch a helliſh moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did neuer enter into my breaſt.

Wherefore euery one of them tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Lord, ſaid: <hi>Is it I Rabbi?</hi> to whom bleſſed Ieſus anſwered, <hi>One of the twelue which dips his hand with me in the diſh ſhall betray me.</hi>

For how wouldeſt thou
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19321:37"/> haue beene able, oh bold and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious <hi>Peter,</hi> to haue cooled the heate of thy furie, and to haue held thy hands from taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon ſuch a damnable Traitor, when as thou didſt not feare to make reſiſtance againſt a great band of Souldiers, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thy beloued Maſter? For as their loue toward louing Ieſus was without meane, ſo their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred toward hatefull <hi>Iudas</hi> would haue beene without moderation, if his treacherous plot had beene openly diſcouered vnto them. But I pray thee ſtay here a while, (oh my ſoule) and ponder within thy inward thoughts, with deuout meditation, the ſacred words and diuine ſpeeches, more ſweet then honie &amp; the honie-combe, which my moſt ſweet Ieſus vttered to his faithfull Diſciples, as he went to the place of his vniuſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, which the Euangeliſt

Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate there ſeriouſlie vpon the wonderfull loue which hee had towards his loyall Diſciples: hee was their Lord and Maſter, yet he did not diſdaine to eate meate, conforting with the meaneſt of them: hee waſhed their feete, hee gaue his bodie and bloud vnto them: and after all theſe things, did not ceaſe to teach them the way of truth, and to feede their ſoules with the ſpirituall food of his coeleſtiall doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Oh moſt mercifull and bleſſed Ieſus, thy words are ſpirit and life, which thou doeſt ſpeake to thy Diſciples: and that knew thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſaid; <hi>Thou haſt the words of eternall life:</hi> For thy words are pure and ſweet to the taſte of them that loue thee; yea,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19321:38"/> more ſweet then honie and the honie-combe. They alſo knew, that thoſe who were ſent by the chiefe Rulers, to lay hands vpon thee, were taken with ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull admiration at the gracious words which did proceede out of thy bleſſed mouth, that they were conſtrained to proclaime thy worthie praiſes, telling them, <hi>That neuer any man ſpake ſo graciouſly:</hi> Oh moſt eloquent Orator! ſtreames of ſweetneſſe doe flow from thy lips, Honie and Milke are euer plentifull vnder thy tongue: Oh how powerfull, how eloquent, how wonderfull were the words which my Lord vttered to his Diſciples in the end of his ſweet Oration! Hee exhorteth them to ſow the ſeedes of true loue in their hearts, and to ſhew forth the fruits thereof one to another.</p>
                     <p>After, hee admoniſheth them, that they ſhould be conſtant in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19321:39"/> their loue, and permanent in their Faith towards him their louing Sauiour. For hee that is deſtitute of the former can neuer be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the latter.</p>
                     <p>And after thoſe things, he fore-telleth them what great dangers they ſhould paſſe, what tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, troubles, afflictions, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, they ſhould ſuffer after his departure, that being fore-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they might be better armed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, hee powreth forth his prayer vnto his heauenly Father for them, that they might not ſhrinke backe like cowards in the day of their triall, nor their Faith faile them in the bitter ſtormes of affliction, but aboue all things, oh my moſt ſweet IESVS, I am not able to wonder enough at thy earneſt Exhortations, which thou diddeſt vſe to kindle the ſparkes of feruent loue towards thee in the hearts of thy faithfull
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19321:39"/> Diſciples, thou doeſt ſpecially aboue all things, charge and command thy Diſciples, that they loue thee, and couet after nothing but thee! Oh how great is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of true loue! Oh how feruent is the vehemencie of a deuout ſpirit: Oh how forcible is the preheminence of a charitable affection! Thou didſt commend, and leaue loue (my beloued Ieſus) as a moſt rare and precious Iewell to thy deare Diſciples.</p>
                     <p>Therefore this is highly to be extolled of vs, and chiefely to be deſired by vs, as our greateſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and onely treaſure: Let him oh louing Ieſus, be abiected out of thy gracious fauour, let him haue no taſte of thy kindnes, that doth not honour thy name, and poſſeſſe his heart with thy loue.</p>
                     <p>Truely, many riuers of water, haue not beene able to put out the fire, nor quench the flame of true

                     </p>
                     <p>Verilie, if I ſhould giue all my ſubſtance, were it neuer ſo great, I would regard it as nothing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then I would want or forgoe my true loue: for hee that loueth thee faithfully (my moſt louing Sauiour) will leaue all things wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, take vp his Croſſe cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and follow thy ſteps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, who ſhall ſeperate mee from thy loue, Oh my moſt ſweet Lord? What ſhall diuert the current of my affections from thee?</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19321:40"/> wound my heart with thy ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt loue, that all my deſires may be turned towards thee, and that I may finde no eaſe, but when I thinke vpon thee, that I may loue thee with all my heart, with all my ſoule, with all my ſtrength: &amp; that my whole will, deſires, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may couet nothing but thee.</p>
                     <p>Let all my cogitations be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occupied in the meditation of thy loue. Seperate and remoue from mee all other deſires of the fleſh, oh my ſweet Ieſus, that my whole heart may be ſolelie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to thee in the day, my ſoule humblie attend vpon thee in the night, and that my ſpirit and bodie may chearefully ſeeke after thee when I awake earely in the morning: for my ſoule <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth after thee, oh God, which art a liuing fountaine, oh when ſhall I come before thy face? when ſhall I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in thy preſence?</hi>

                     <p>And what doe I craue more, what doe I couet ſo much as that my Ieſus may dwell and remaine in mee?

                     <p>IT was the cuſtome of our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Ieſus, to aſcend vp often vnto the <hi>Mount Oliuet, which was diſtant the ſpace of a mile from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that he might pray.</hi> There al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was a Towne named <hi>Gethſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani, where there was a Garden, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated on the Mountaines, into the which, beloued Ieſus was accuſtomed

                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore after he had ended his glorious and bleſſed Supper, and alſo his ſweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exhortations made to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued and faithfull Diſciples, hee reſorted towards this place, late in the night, accompanied with them.</p>
                     <p>Here (oh my ſoule) behold thy Ieſus, looke vpon that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lambe, which goeth of his owne accord to the ſlaughter.</p>
                     <p>Take a view of his Diſciples which follow him, hauing their faces pale with feare, their mindes perplexed with doubts, and their hearts drowned with flouds of ſorrow.</p>

                     <p>Thou ſeeſt how our moſt gentle Maſter hath commanded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to lincke their hearts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the bands of true loue, and to arme themſelues with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience againſt the daies of danger, when he went to the mount <hi>Oliuet</hi> to pray. Wherefore being about to enter into a fearefull fight, to beginne a dangerous battell, and to encounter many deadly foes, hee animateth his courage, and armeth himſelfe with prayers.</p>
                     <p>Learne thou alſo by this his example, in the day of thy tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and houre of thy affliction, to haue thy ſpeedy recourſe vnto Prayer: Wee can finde no better weapon wherewith to offend our foes. Wee can vſe no better ſhield wherewith to defend our friends.</p>

                     <p>Thou ſeeſt alſo my ſoule, how thy Sauiour Ieſus preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Prayer, did leaue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of his Diſciples, and he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſelected three out of his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo that they three which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had beene ſpectators in <hi>mount Tabor,</hi> of his <hi>glorious Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> might now be <hi>companions</hi> and <hi>eye-witneſſes</hi> of his <hi>grieuous Paſſion:</hi> that <hi>in the mouth of two or three eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word might be eſtabliſhed.</hi>

                     <p>Learne thou alſo to leaue the ſocietie of men, when thou doeſt addreſſe thy ſelfe to talke with God. When thy Sauiour did pray, he aſcended vp into a mountaine, to teach vs that although our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies doe remaine vpon earth, yet our cogitations ſhould mount and ſoare vp into heauen by the wings of deuout prayer: he pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth the compaſſion of his heart, he being a good Shepheard doth diligently watch ouer his

                     <p>Oh great loue! how conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, euen vnto the end, did he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and loue the <hi>little flocke of his faithfull Diſciples,</hi> being indeede their moſt kinde and louing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, when in the moſt grieuous fits of his heauy Agonie, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt pangs of his Paſſion, he was carefull to procure their reſt in that little time which was limited vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Teach me (my mercifull Ieſu) not onely to be tender-hearted towards my poore Brethren, in the bright dayes of my flouriſhing <hi>proſperitie,</hi> but breed alſo within my bowels, ſuch a feeling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards them in the hard time of my <hi>clowdie aduerſitie,</hi> that I may not onely wiſh mine owne eaſe, and labour for mine owne cauſe, but alſo that I may be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                     <p>Oh great, worthy, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull humilitie! when as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equall and coeternall with God, doth proſtrate himſelfe to the earth, when he prayeth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as though hee were a moſt baſe and wretched creature, and ſubmitteth the iſſue of his Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the pleaſure and will of his Father.</p>

Oh would my head might be turned into a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or teares, and my bowels melt with tender compaſſion in this my ſorrowfull meditation, when I thinke vpon the dolorous

                     <p>Oh how was thy bodie pained? how was thy minde perplexed? how were all thy ſenſes tired in this great worke of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How heauie is the weight of my ſinnes, that diſſolueth the bleſſed bodie of my Lord vnto ſuch a wonderfull ſweat? How is the <hi>beautie of thy face,</hi> which the <hi>Angels</hi> doe behold with <hi>ioy and gladneſſe,</hi> changed with redneſſe, through exceſſiue heate? how immoderately is it moiſtned with ſhowers of watriſh and bloudie ſweate? Thou diddeſt but ſpeake the word, and thy word was a worke at the firſt Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3. But now I ſee thee ſweating, toyling, yea, thy heart aking, while thou art acting the worke of our Redemption.</p>

What ſhall I ſay? what ſhall I doe (my good Ieſu) my heart is as hard as iron, and my bowels no ſofter then braſſe, I haue no ſenſe of tender compaſſion, nor any feeling of ſorrowfull compunction: mine eies are as dry as the Pumiſe ſtone, I cannot ſhed one teare, to weepe for my ſinnes, which were the ſource of thy ſorrow, and the cauſe of thy paſſion. Indeed, my heart ſhould diſtill drops of bloud, and mine eyes ſhould trickle downe teares, when I meditate in my minde on the intolerable paines which thou didſt ſuffer to ſatisfie the Iuſtice of thy Father for my grieuous ſins, and to ſaue my guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſoule. Oh how can I excuſe; nay rather, how ſhould I but accuſe my wretched and vile ingratitude?</p>

                     <p>Where ſhall I hide my head for ſhame? where ſhall I ſhrowd my ſelfe from thy preſence?

                     <p>Send thy Angell (oh Lord) to bring mee conſolation in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſefull time of my tribulation, for thou haſt ordained them to aſſiſt vs in our prayers, and to comfort vs in our ſorrow.</p>

                     <p>Here (oh my Soule,) the firſt matter of our Meditation, is the monſtrous ingratitude of a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Diſciple towards his gracious and louing Maſter: how odious is his deede vnto my thoughts? how doth his helliſh madnes tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my minde?</p>
                     <p>Oh that my tongue might be more bitter then gall, to exclaime againſt the diſſembling hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of ſuch a deceitfull Diſciple: and my ſpeech more ſweet then honie, to proclaime the ſingular ſinceritie of ſo louing a Maſter, that our ſoules might abhorre the infidelitie of the one, and our hearts for euermore, imbrace the faithfulneſſe of the other.</p>
                     <p>Oh thou moſt wicked wretch, thou wretched, ſtubborne, and obſtinate Traitor, thou <hi>Childe of the Diuell,</hi> thou <hi>Sonne of perdition,</hi>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:19321:56"/> what furious malice hardened thy heart?</p>

                     <p>Was there no ſparke of grace left in thy breaſt? had impudence ſo blinded thine eyes, and crueltie taken ſuch ſure poſſeſſion in thy heart, that nothing could change thy bloudie minde, and ſtay the rage of thy franticke moode, wherewith the Diuell had bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thy ſoule, and poiſoned thy affections?</p>

                     <p>Tell mee I pray thee, had hee beene able to haue done theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, if God had not beene with him?

                     <p>Remember thou moſt wretched creature, and vngratefull Diſciple, how thy humble Maſter waſhed thy feete. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.5.</p>
                     <p>How ſhould this wonderfull hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of ſo great a Maſter haue humbled thy minde, being ſo baſe a Seruant? Remember how hee alwaies extended the tokens of

                     <p>Conſider thou moſt vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and cruell Traitor, how often my louing Ieſus did mildely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh thee, that thou ſhouldeſt retire from thy wicked purpoſe, whoſe all-ſeeing eye was able to penetrate into the darkeſt corners of thy heart, and to ſearch the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of thy inward bowels.</p>
                     <p>It might haue checked thy guiltie conſcience, when hee ſaid (after hee had waſhed his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples feete) <hi>Yee are cleane, but not all: Iohn</hi> 13.11. And againe, <hi>I ſpeake not of all of you, I know whom I haue choſen, Iohn</hi> 13.18.</p>
                     <p>But although theſe generall reprehenſions were motiues of ſmall moment, to mollifie thy ſtonie heart, yet hee ſpake vnto thee particularly, ſaying: <hi>Doe that

                     <p>And who but God is able to know the ſecrets of the heart, and to diſcouer our hidden cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?</p>
                     <p>But was not thy heart as flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as an Adamant, that it did not relent with ſorrow? was not thy fore-head as hard as braſſe, that thou didſt not bluſh for ſhame? Were not thine eyes more drie then a rocke, that they could ſhed no teares, when thy louing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and my beloued Lord ſaid mildelie vnto thee, <hi>What Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?</hi> Luke 22.48.</p>
                     <p>Oh great humilitie! exceeding meekeneſſe! moſt admirable cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of my Sauiour Ieſus! Yet neither the mildnes of his words,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19321:58"/> nor wonderfulneſſe of his works could ſoften thy obdurate heart, or reclaime thy obſtinate minde, oh thou pernicious Traitor! My Sauiour called him <hi>friend, Mat.</hi> 26.10. whom hee knew to be a direfull foe, that the meekneſſe of the name, might haue a little cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the furie of his nature: but the Diuell had ſowed ſuch naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſeede in the furrowes of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous heart, that hee became a wicked guide, to deliuer his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Maſter into the hands of his bloudie enemies, who hating his <hi>innocent life,</hi> had longed for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, to put him to a cruell and ſhamefull death.</p>
                     <p>Tell mee thou damned <hi>Iudas,</hi> what brought thee into ſuch an helliſh Phrenſie, that thou didſt complot with the bloudie Iewes to betray thy gracious Lord with a token of kindneſſe? Had thirſtie Couetouſneſſe ſo inflamed thy
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19321:59"/> minde that thou didſt run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſell thy ſoule for a little piece of monie.</p>
                     <p>If thou hadſt come like a foe, thy crime had not beene ſo hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, nor thy crueltie ſo odious: But thou like a couſening hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, didſt cunningly maske thy deadly hate with the vizard of counterfeit loue.</p>
                     <p>Thou didſt ſalute my louing Ieſus with no friendly, but a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kiſſe, that with this token of peace and kindneſſe, thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt caſt a miſt before the eyes of his faithfull Diſciples, that they might thinke thou hadſt nothing to doe with thoſe wicked perſons who came to apprehend their Lord &amp; Maſter: thou thoughteſt thou haddeſt complotted ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, and contriued thy matters ſo carefully, that all ſhould haue beene hidden in darkneſſe, and no man haue knowne thy damnable

Such iugling hypocriticall trickes may often be hooded from the dim ſight of men, but they can neuer be hidden from the all-ſeeing eye of Almightie God: thou cameſt with a word of peace in thy mouth, when thou didſt pretend nothing but warre in thy heart: thy ſpeech was as ſoft as Butter, but thy inward thoughts were more ſharpe then a Raiſor: thou didſt preſume to offer a Traitors kiſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.49. to my bleſſed Sauiour, when thy lips were full of poyſon, and thy throate an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Sepulcher: thou cameſt like a ſubtle Foxe to ſalute him with a

But firſt of all kiſſe his bleſſed feete, and <hi>bathe them,</hi> as <hi>Mary</hi> did, with the teares of true repentance, ſighing and groaning with ſenſe of thy ſinnes, that the comfort of his mercie may be extended vnto thee, when ſuch welcome tokens of thy loue are beſtowed vpon him. Proſtrate thy ſelfe (oh my Soule) on the earth, that thou maiſt ceaſe to be wretched. Imbrace the feete of thy IESV, pacifie them with thy teares, who ſpared not to poure

And then doe we kiſſe his gracious hands with a reuerent and lowly heart, when our mouthes are filled with his worthy praiſes, for his bountifull benefits freely beſtowed vpon vs, proclaiming his wonderfull mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and diſclaiming our vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie merit, whoſe hand hath raiſed vs vp out of the mire, and hath aduanced vs to euerlaſting honor.

                     <p>Shew vs the light of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, oh my louing Ieſus, and then our hearts ſhall be filled with gladneſſe, and wee ſhall be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the abundance of thine euerlaſting goodneſſe: for to ſee the beautie of thy face is our chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt felicitie, and to be baniſhed from thy face is our endleſſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie. <hi>Therefore kiſſe the Sonne leſt he be angry, for if his wrath be kindled (yea but a little) bleſſed are all they that truſt in him.

                     <p>Oh that all treacherous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and bloudie minded Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors might haue a view of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Iudas,</hi> ſtrangling himſelfe with an Halter; that the horror of his curſed death vpon earth, and the terror of his continuall paines in hell, might ſtay the rage of their furious mindes, and manacle their bloudie hands: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though deſperate <hi>Iudas</hi> was ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with horror of a guiltie conſcience, that hee could haue no peace in his fearefull thoughts, nor chuſe but crie in his tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting miſeries, depriued of all hope of comfortable mercie, <hi>I haue ſinned in betraying the innocent bloud, Matth.</hi> 27.4. and could finde no other medicine to cure

Yet let mee not ſo bitterly inueigh againſt the monſtrous fact of curſed <hi>Iudas,</hi> that I forget the mildeneſſe of my mercifull IESVS, who did
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19321:63"/> not rate and reuile him, calling him in name (as hee was indeede) a damnable Traitor, ſaluting his Maſter with a kiſſe as a token of his loue: but (alas) it was onely to betray him.</p>
                     <p>My patient Sauiour Ieſus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him by the name of a friend, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.50. whom hee knew to be a deadly foe, that the mildneſſe of the name might haue bred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe in his heart, but that the Diuell had taken full poſſeſſion in his minde, and ruled powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouer his thoughts.</p>
                     <p>But why did my louing Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our vſe ſuch affable words to ſuch a deteſtable Traitor? It was to teach mee to repreſſe mine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from raging furie, when any of his wicked brood lie in waite to take away my life, and ſecretly ſeeke to contriue my death.</p>
                     <p>Teach mee my Ieſu, to imitate
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19321:63"/> thy patience, when my curteſie is rewarded with crueltie, when ſuppoſed friends proue faithleſſe, and when my kindneſſe is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with bad words, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with worſe deedes. Thou haſt willed vs to <hi>bleſſe them that curſe vs,</hi> and to <hi>pray for our perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, Mat.</hi> 5.44. But our fleſh is wayward, and it cannot away with this doctrine, wherefore I beſeech thee my gracious Lord, to lend me thy helping hand, it is thine owne worke to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme my minde to thy bleſſed will, that I may be made obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious and obedient to thy ſacred Law.</p>
                     <p>But now (my Soule) turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide thine eies from hatefull <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> to looke vpon louing <hi>Peter,</hi> who beganne to be touched with the heate of true loue, when hee ſaw his Maſter attached by the hands of his enemies, and did
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19321:64"/> boldlie obiect his owne life vnto danger, that hee might deliuer his harmeleſſe Maſter out of perill, and that hee might performe in deede that which a little before he had profeſſed in word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.35. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.10. As his loue was much, ſo his courage was great in the defence of his dearelie beloued Maſter, hee regarded not the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that came againſt him, hee reſpected not how well they were armed, his true heart dreaded no danger.</p>
                     <p>But ſo ſoone as hee ſaw his dread maſter Iudaſly betraied, and cruellie apprehended by his mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious foes, he drew out his ſword and laid about him, and cut off <hi>Malchus</hi> his eare.</p>
                     <p>Thy loue was ſtrong, louing <hi>Peter,</hi> although thy ſtrength was feeble, to reſiſt ſo manie, ſo ill-minded, and ſo well armed: I cannot but commend thee for
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19321:64"/> thy loue, although thy louing Maſter doth not praiſe thee for thy deede; thou diddeſt ſhew a token of thy feruent loue and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, although (alas) he ſtood not in neede of thy weake prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: my louing Sauiour came to fulfill the will of his Father, to ſuffer death; yea, to ſuffer a cruell and ſhamefull death on the croſſe, that we might be reſtored to life, be freed, and deliuered from the curſe.</p>
                     <p>It was the feruencie of thy loue, that had inflamed thy aged heart with courage, thou couldeſt not hold thy hands, when thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſee thy beloued Maſter ſo violently apprehended, ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhly handled, and haled to the ſlaughter.</p>
                     <p>For whoſoeuer (my louing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour) hath his heart knit vnto thee with bands of true loue, hee dreadeth no danger for thy ſake,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19321:65"/> but will be more willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe his life, then to leaue his true loue. But thou diddeſt not deſire (my louing Ieſus) nay, thou didſt not allow that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould ſhew his manhood, or attempt by anie force to reſcue thee out of the hands of thy cruell foes: thou diddeſt diſcloſe vnto thy faithfull Diſciples, the dangerous daies that were to come, and tell them of the bitter afflictions which were to enſue, and that they ſhould be like Sheepe ſcattered without a Shepheard. But it was not that they ſhould arme their bodies with weapons, but their heads and ſoules with patience. So indeed the loue of thy Apoſtle was full of zeale, but yet it was barren &amp; void of knowledge, who had beene often forewarned that thou ſhouldeſt ſuffer a cruell and ſhamefull death to fulfill the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and do the will of thy Father.</p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:19321:65"/>
                     <p>Wherefore (oh my moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Ieſus) ſo inflame my heart with thy loue, that I may freelie confeſſe it with my mouth, and ſo performe it with my heart, that I may not onely be prepared to looſe my libertie, but to forgoe my life for the name of my Lord Ieſus, who is bleſſed for euer.</p>

                     <p>Conſider further, oh my ſoule, the diſciples of my Sauiour flying
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19321:71"/> for feare, and lamenting with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when they ſaw their moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued maſter <hi>traiterouſly betrayed, ignominiouſly abuſed, and led like an innocent Lambe to the ſhambles.</hi>

                     <p>Attend to their ſighing and groning, to their weeping and moning, for loath they were, to leaue ſo louing and ſo well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a Maſter.</p>
                     <p>But why ſhould feare of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger haue bin ſo violent, or dread of death ſo ſtrong, as to pull them from ſo deare a friend?</p>
                     <p>They profeſſed they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine conſtant, and that no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſhould abate their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but their words proued no deedes, and all was but vaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: Selfe-loue of their owne ſecuritie, made them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their diſtreſſed Maſter in his captiuitie.</p>
                     <p>But tell mee bold-hearted <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> why didſt thou like a coward

I know thou didſt ſhew ſome ſigne of courage, and thou beganſt to play the man when thy Maiſter was firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, but it was but done in a fit of thine anger, and thy heate was ſoone cooled: thy promiſe great, and thy performance little: when thou wert in mount Tabor, and ſaw but ſome beames; yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome ſparkles of the eternall glory of thy bleſſed Maiſter, then thy ſenſes were ſo rauiſhed, and thy minde ſo amazed, that thou diddeſt crie out, <hi>Bonum eſt eſſe hic, Mat.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Marke</hi> 9.2. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.28. It is good to be here, let vs build three Tabernacles: but now thou doeſt not ſay, <hi>Bonum eſt eſſe hic:</hi> It is good to tarry here with my poore diſgraced Maſter.</p>

                     <p>Say thou didſt loue thy Maſter well, yet it appeareth thou didſt loue thy ſelfe better: oh why did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou make ſuch a vaine oſtentation of thy courage, and yet afterwards ſhew thy ſelfe ſuch a coward?</p>
                     <p>But take heed, oh my ſoule, that thou doſt not ſo vehemently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh againſt faint-hearted <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of his fearefull fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that thou forget thy ſelfe, and paſſe by thine owne infirmity.</p>
                     <p>Wee all loue Chriſt, when our <hi>cups may ouerflow with wine, and our bellies be filled with the fineſt wheate,</hi> but the heate of our loue is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cooled, if but a ſmall blaſt of ſtormie perſecution doe bluſter againſt vs.</p>

                     <p>Wee could all be content to <hi>eate pleaſant hony, and to feede our ſelues with ſweet milke:</hi> but our mouthes are filled with <hi>murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and our hearts with <hi>grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging:</hi> the time is <hi>long,</hi> and the iourney <hi>tedious,</hi> while wee trauell in the wildernes of this world to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>heauenly Canaan.

                     <p>Alas, were the Diſciples of my Sauiour, ſo fearefull at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, who had beene ſo often fore-tolde of that day, and had beene ſo well inſtructed by their louing Maiſter, to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

                     <p>I know mine owne imbecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, my <hi>powerfull Lord,</hi> I confeſſe mine infirmitie, I feele my heart quake, and I perceiue my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to quaile, ſo ſoone as I ſee but a darke cloud of affliction, and ſtand in dread of euery ſtorme of perſecution.</p>
                     <p>Strengthen my heart, oh Lord, with <hi>Chriſtian Fortitude,</hi> that my minde may not be diſmayed with feare, nor my ſenſes drowned with the ſtreames of <hi>immoderate ſorrow,</hi> whenſoeuer I muſt drinke of the bitter waters of affliction for the profeſſion of thy name, or

                     <p>And here thou maiſt admire at the incomparable mildneſſe, and wonder at the wonderfull pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of my gentle Sauiour, who did modeſtly beare ſo great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, that hee gaue not him an euill word, who had done him ſuch a <hi>cruell deede,</hi> but ſaid to him mildly: friend, <hi>if I haue ſpoken euilly beare witneſſe of euill: but if I haue ſaid well, why ſmiteſt thou mee?

                     <p>Alas for mee, a moſt wretched ſinner, that my Lord ſhould ſuffer ſuch great and grieuous affliction for my ſake, and yet, that I ſhould ſtill remaine ſenceleſſe in my ſins, and haue no remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for my hainous offences?</p>
                     <p>Haue mercy vpon mee, moſt

                     <p>NOw let vs ceaſe a while to meditate on my Sauiour, and conſider how <hi>Peter</hi> carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the afflictions of his Maſter.</p>
                     <p>He was loath to leaue him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did loue him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although at the firſt hee fled, yet hee returned againe with the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19321:82"/> other Diſciple, who by friendſhip brought him into the Pallace of the high Prieſt: and as <hi>Peter</hi> ſtood there by the fire, a maide looked vpon him, and ſaid to them that were by, <hi>This man alſo was with Ieſus of Nazareth.</hi> But <hi>Peter,</hi> who not long before had made ſuch great brags of his loue, was now ſo daunted with feare, that he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied his ſeruice, ſaying: <hi>I know not the man.</hi> And a little after, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſayd vnto him, <hi>Art not thou alſo one of his Diſciples?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that now <hi>Peter</hi> was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſimply to denie him, but hee beganne earneſtly to forſweare him.</p>
                     <p>Now within a while after, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came and ſaid: <hi>Verily, thou art one of them.</hi> And then <hi>Peter</hi> began to curſe and ſweare, ſaying: <hi>I know not the man whom thou ſpeakeſt of, and immediately the Cocke crew.</hi> And the Lord who ſtood not far off in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19321:83"/> the hands of the wicked, looked back vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> not refuſing faint-hearted <hi>Peter</hi> to be his ſeruant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had denied, and abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him for his Maiſter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then</hi> Peter <hi>remembred the words which Ieſus had ſpoken to him, and he went out &amp; wept bitterly.</hi> Mat. 26.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs ſeriouſly meditate on the frailtie of <hi>Peter,</hi> that ſeeing ſo ſtout a Souldier ſo ſoone daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with feare, we may take heed, not to preſume too much vpon our owne weakeneſſe, leſt we play the cowards, and ſtart backe as he did, when wee are put to our tryall.</p>
                     <p>Conſider (oh my ſoule) the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uency of his loue, and greatneſſe of his feare, the willingneſſe of his minde, and weakeneſſe of his might.</p>
                     <p>I dare not ſay but that <hi>Peter</hi> did loue his Lord, and was ſorry for the diſtreſſed eſtate of his maſter,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19321:83"/> although his heart fainted, and his ſtomacke failed in the time of danger: hee thought hee ſhould haue beene able to haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in deedes, that which he had ſo boldly boaſted in wordes: but alas, hee did not know his owne imbecilitie, his eyes were blinded that hee could not ſee his owne infirmitie, the ſpirit indeede was willing, but the fleſh was weake.</p>
                     <p>He began to ſhew ſome courage when he drew his ſword, and cut of <hi>Malchus</hi> his eare, but alas, it was ſoone abated, and he fled from his Maiſter, when hee ſaw him in the hands of his enemies, and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his cruell foes. And albeit hee was ſo bolde ſpirited then, that hee durſt reſiſt a multitude of men, yet hee was ſo timerous now, that being terrified with the voyce of a Mayde, hee did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his gratious LORD,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19321:84"/> and flatly denie his louing Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſo ſoone were his boaſting words turned into cowardly deeds, &amp; the profeſſed conſtancie of his loue found moſt inconſtant in the day of tryall.</p>
                     <p>So we may note, that <hi>Peter</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed hee was able to haue done great exploits while hee was with Ieſus, but we ſee the vigor of his courage was ſoone diminiſhed, and the heate of his loue cooled when hee was ſeparated from his Lord Ieſus: ſo long as he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy peaceably his bleſſed ſocietie, ſo long he dreaded no danger, he liued in ſecuritie. In time of peace, he thought of no war: In time of calme weather, he feared no ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſtorme: But when he ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the houſe of the high Prieſt, where hee ſaw his poore Maſter ſpightfully derided, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and cruelly ſcourged, then his courage was cooled, his haughtie
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19321:84"/> words proued no deedes, and hee became a ſtarke coward.</p>
                     <p>Learne thou alſo (oh my ſoule) by the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> to loue thy Lord Ieſus, but ſo to loue him, that no affliction or calamitie may compell thee to leaue him. But ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate me from the loue of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation or anguiſh? ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution or hunger? I am readie not onely to be bound, but alſo to die in Hieruſalem for the name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> Learne likewiſe by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Peter,</hi> not fondly to vaunt of thine owne courage, or to boaſt of thy ſtrength: let the remembrance of his fall be as a bridle, to reſtraine thee from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning headlong into the like fault.</p>
                     <p>Say not in the proſperous time of thine <hi>aboundance</hi> (vvhen all things ſucceede happily accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy wiſh, and nothing fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out contrarie to thy deſire) <hi>I
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19321:85"/> ſhall neuer be moued,</hi> leaſt afterward thou be conſtrained to change thy note, vveeping vvith bitter teares for thy folly, and lamenting for thy <hi>preſumption,</hi> with ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſighes: ſaying, <hi>Thou didſt turne away thy face from mee, and I was troubled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Teach mee, oh Lord, to know mine owne weakeneſſe: open the eies of my vnderſtanding, that I may ſee the <hi>frailtie</hi> of my <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>fickleneſſe</hi> of my minde, when any cloud of perſecution doth appeare ouer my head, or any dread of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affliction trouble my heart.</p>
                     <p>I often preſume vvith <hi>Peter,</hi> that I could goe to priſon vvith thee, abide any torment for thy ſake, yea loſe my life for thy loue, my louing Sauiour: but (alas) I ſee by the frailtie of thy beloued Diſciple, that I ſhould proue but a daſtard, when I come to fight thy battell, and begin to ſeeke ſome
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19321:85"/> 
                        <hi>couerture,</hi> to hide my head from danger.</p>
                     <p>For how can I boaſt of my <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> or bragge of my manhood, when as one of thy ſtouteſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who had beene ſo long trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp vnder thee, and had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo many encouragements by thee, began to faint, at the word of ſo weake an enemie, that hee did denie the ſeruice of ſo good a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, onely for feare, before he felt the bitterneſſe of affliction: What is man that hee may boaſt of his ſtrength, or be proud of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, when the beſt is ſo vnable to performe a good action, that he is altogether vnable to conceiue a good motion?</p>
                     <p>Lighten thou (oh my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord) my darke and obſcure vnderſtanding, that I may not fondly runne into the ſnares of temptation, through a vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of my owne power, or
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19321:86"/> through a fond preſumption of my owne ſtrength, ſeeing I am ſo weake that I cannot conceiue any good thought in my heart, nor do any good deed with my hands, vnleſſe thy diuine grace doe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne mine affections, and direct the courſe of my actions. But oh my moſt mercifull Sauiour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the allurements of the flattering world ſhould ſo intice me, the pleaſures of the wanton fleſh ſo ouercome mee, and the feare of perſecution ſo terrifie me, that I ſhould be aſhamed of thy liuerie, and denie ſo gracious a Lord: yet vouchſafe oh my ſweet Ieſu, to turne thy fauourable eies towards mee, that my faith may not vtterly faile, though it begin to quaile, and that thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue mee vvhen I begin to ſhrinke from thee. Oh let me not preſume of thy loue, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of thy mercy.</p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:19321:86"/>
                     <p>Let remembrance of thy words wound my heart, and awake my ſleepie conſcience, that my ſoule may be caſt downe with true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and that I may vveepe, yea vveepe bitterly vvith ſorrowfull <hi>Peter.</hi> Luk. 22.62. for my ſinnes, that I may be made partaker of the benefit of thy comfortable mercie, and obtaine remiſſion of my grieuous tranſgreſſions, by true Repentance as he did.</p>
                     <p>Thou haſt left this example of the fall of thy louing Diſciple, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in thy holy word, not to animate vs to commit the ſinne of preſumption, but to comfort vs that wee runne not into the pit of wofull deſperation, when wee are ouertaken with the like fault, and haue committed the like fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: therefore teach me (oh Lord) ſo to preſume of thy mercie, that I may alwaies ſtand in awe of thy Iuſtice.</p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:19321:87"/>
                     <p>I am not aſſured that thou wilt turne thine eies towards mee, as thou didſt towards him, ſo that my heart may be ſmitten with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and mine eies ſtreame forth bitter teares of true Repentance, and that thou wilt receiue me into thy bleſſed ſeruice againe, as thou didſt him, after I haue denied thee to be my Lord and Maſter.</p>
                     <p>It was thy free mercie to afford vnto him ſuch an vnſpeakeable grace of thy extraordinarie loue: he could plead no worthineſſe of words, nor merit of workes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue thy fauour.</p>
                     <p>But (oh moſt gratious Lord) if my guiltie conſcience doe at anie time tell mee that I haue or doe commit the ſame offence, yet vouchſafe, that I may reſort to the euerlaſting fountaine of thy plentifull mercie, that there my thirſtie ſoule may bee refreſhed with the ſweet waters of comfort,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19321:87"/> ſo that it may neither be drowned in the Sea of exceſſiue ſorrow, nor wounded with the Darts of cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe diſpaire.</p>
                     <p>Now conſider thou, (oh my ſoule) the place where <hi>Peter</hi> was, and the conditions of the people who were vvith him, vvhen hee made ſuch a fearefull defection, from his gracious Lord, and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his loue, towards his kinde and louing Maſter: He was in the Palace of the high Prieſt, <hi>who ſate in counſell</hi> with the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes,</hi> againſt the Lord and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, amongſt a wicked crewe of theſe cruell Miniſters, vvhoſe mindes were incenſed with furie, and hands armed with crueltie, to torment my innocent Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>Marke how ſoone he was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by their vvicked manners, how ſoone his ſoule was corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their naughtie conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for now he began to proteſt
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19321:88"/> with ſwearing, and to affirme with curſing, that he knew not his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Maiſter, to whom not long before, hee had made a ſolemne vow, not onely to forgoe his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, for his cauſe, but alſo to looſe his life for his ſake. <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.33.</p>
                     <p>Oh fearefull downfall, of ſo great an Apoſtle! for if his louing Maſter, and mercifull Sauiour, had not beene more conſtant towards him in his loue, and tenderly compaſſionate towards him by his mercie, hee had neuer recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe, but had periſhed for euer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>No man can touch Pitch, but hee ſhall be defiled: no man can tread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thornes with barefeete, but he ſhall be pricked, nor any man holde his hands amongst fierie coales, but they will be burned:</hi> Euen ſo, no man can remaine amongſt lewd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and conuerſe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19321:88"/> of the wicked, but his minde ſhall be ſtained with the ſpots of impietie, his conſcience wounded with the thornes of ſinne, and his ſoule made loathſome vvith the botches, and blaines of iniquitie.</p>
                     <p>But ſo ſoone as my beloued Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus had turned his eies towards <hi>Peter,</hi> and vvith his lookes had awakened his <hi>drowſie memorie,</hi> then perplexed <hi>Peter</hi> remembred the words of his Maſter, ſo that his heart being ſurcharged vvith ſorrow, and his eyes flowing with teares, he left that wicked compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and went out and wept: yea he wept bitterly. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.62. <hi>Teach me oh Lord, to leaue the dangerous ſocietie of the wicked: neither let mee deſire, or delight to dwell in the Tents of the vngodly:</hi> Let me alſo learne, by the example of thy ſorrowfull Diſciple, to goe into ſome ſecret place, and with-draw my ſelfe from the people, when I call my

                     <p>Then (oh my good Lord) ſo deepely vvound my conſcience vvith horrour of my deteſtable ſinnes, that I may offer vp a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and contrite heart vnto thee, becauſe thou art alwaies vvell pleaſed vvith ſuch a Sacrifice, and it ſendeth vp a ſweet ſauour into thy noſethrils.</p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:19321:89"/>
                     <p>Now conſider (oh my ſoule) that as the treſpaſſe of <hi>Peters</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vvas great, ſo his ſorrow vvas grieuous: as the remembrance of his fall vvas <hi>ſowre,</hi> ſo the ſtreames of his <hi>teares</hi> vvere bitter: yet they vvere not ſo bitter vnto him for feare of puniſhment, as they vvere bitter, becauſe hee had denied ſo ſweet and ſo louing a Maſter: the remembrance of his horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude vvas more bitter vnto him then gall, and more vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant then wormewood: his teares vvere bitter vnto him, in reſpect of his preſumption, who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo much, and performed ſo little: and they vvere bitter vnto him, vvhen he thought vpon the ſweet loue of his Maſter, and the great benefits hee had receiued of him.</p>
                     <p>And yet their bitterneſſe vvas mixed vvith ſweetneſſe, becauſe they were ſignes of his hartie ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19321:90"/> and tokens of his true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>for where true repentance go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before, remiſſion of ſinnes alwaies followeth after. Eze.</hi> 33.19.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſeeſt alſo, that the lookes of the Lord, did draw out teares from <hi>Peters</hi> eies; Neither is it any wonder, for the eies of the Lord were as a flame of fire, and the eies of <hi>Peter</hi> as Ice, vvhich began to melt into teares, by the influence of their heat, as true tokens of his ſorrowfull, relenting, and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heart.</p>
                     <p>Oh happie are thine eies, my bleſſed Sauiour, vvhich doe ſo warme the coldneſſe of our harts, that they may bee able to haue ſome ſenſe of thy loue, and doe ſo illuminate our dimme vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that we may ſee our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and ſeeing, may ſigh and weepe for our tranſgreſſions.

                     <p>Oh my moſt bountifull Ieſu! oh my moſt mercifull Lord, haue mercy vpon mee, pitty my vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſe, ſhut not the dore of thy compaſſion againſt mee; oh let me taſte of the ſweetneſſe of thy wonted clemency, vvhich haue ſo often, ſo ſtubbornely renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thee, through the peeuiſhnes of my will, ſo often denyed thee by my wicked words, and moſt often forſworne thee by my wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched deeds.</p>

                     </p>

I know my moſt gratious Lord, it did flow from the fountaine of thy vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable loue, in tendring the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eſtate of me a moſt wretched ſinner: and becauſe thou vvert moued with the bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards mee, a moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne and miſerable creature.</p>
                     <p>Thy exceeding loue vvas the cauſe of thy admirable humilitie:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19321:95"/> and thy vnſpeakeable mercie, the ſoueraigne medicine to cure my miſerie.

                     <p>Poſſeſſe my heart vvith true humilitie, that my thoughts may not thirſt after vaine glorie, nor mine affections hunt after world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour.

                     <p>Now, when they had ſtripped him of his cloathes, they bound him to a pillar, to endure their cruell ſtripes, hauing baniſhed pitty from their hearts, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced cruelty with their hands: ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they laſh him on the backe, ſometime they ſcourge him on the breſt: Now they let their ſmarting whips flie on his ſhoulders, anon they ſtrike him on his armes: they ſuffer no part of his body to bee free from blowes, and they grieue his righteous ſoule with bitter

                     <p>Now what meaſure of wordes can be ſo great, or what <hi>voyce ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement,</hi> as may fully expreſſe the extreame impietie of the bloudy Iewes, towards my bleſſed <hi>Ieſus.</hi> When ſuch helliſh fury did rule and reuell in their fiery harts, that in the middeſt of ſo many bitter paines and <hi>pangs</hi> of his body, and

                     </p>
                     <p>For we doe not read that they were put to the toile to beare their <hi>Croſſes,</hi> whoſe bodies vvere more able, becauſe they had not felt one fit of the grieuous paines, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered one iot of the great tortures wherewith my ſorrowful Sauiour had beene all the night before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely vexed and cruelly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>

                     <p>Oh my louing Lord! Oh my moſt beloued Ieſu, thou art now become a laughing-ſtocke to the barbarous Gentiles, and matter of deriſion to the <hi>perfidious</hi> Iewes.</p>

                     <p>They ſcorned, deſpiſed, flouted and derided thee, bearing thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy Croſſe with patience towards the place of execution, whereon thou ſhouldeſt ſuffer a moſt bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, bitter, and ſhamefull death.</p>
                     <p>And ſo went my Lord Ieſus, with conſtant humanity towards the place where he was to ſuffer the deadly pangs of their extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt tyranny, whoſe knees were ſo weake, and legs ſo feeble, that they were not able to ſupport the weight of ſo heauy a burthen, which with ſuch diſdainful indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they had impoſed vpon him, that thereby they might ſo much the more increaſe his deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and multiply his dolorous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.

                     <p>Now when thoſe malicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors ſaw that my vvearyed <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſo ſurcharged vvith his heauy <hi>Croſſe,</hi> being ſo weightie in reſpect of the ponderous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and alſo ſo cumberſome, in regard of the extraordinary length, that although hee had a willing minde, yet that he had not ſufficient ſtrength to carry ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie a load: then they compelled <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> (the father of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Rufus</hi>) to eaſe him of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and to follow my tyred <hi>Chriſt</hi> with that painefull Croſſe. What, did their ſtonie hearts now begin to relent, vvith any motiue of compaſſion towards my poore afflicted Ieſus?</p>
                     <p>No, for the Curres were more curteous, that licked the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſoares of hungry <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
                        <pb n="272" facs="tcp:19321:126"/> that lay crying, and dying for want of foode at the gate of their churliſh maiſter, then thoſe vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Gentiles, and ſtiffe-nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Iewes were to my innocent Ieſus.</p>
                     <p>For how ſhould their mindes be affected with any ſparke of pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whoſe harts were drowned in ſo deepe a ſea of impietie?</p>
                     <p>But becauſe they were loth that my Sauiour ſhould end his tedious life before hee came where hee ſhould ſuffer a moſt painefull, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and ſhamefull death, they graunted him a little eaſe, that he might goe with better ſpeed, and make a little more haſte to the place of execution, where they ſhould play, like the infernall Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the laſt act of their bloody Tragedie.</p>
                     <p>Oh my ſadde and ſorrowfull ſoule, how canſt thou calme the waues of thy flowing ſorrow?

                     <p>Oh my moſt mercifull Ieſu! Oh my moſt louing Lord! Oh why was not I with thee at that time, my ſweet Chriſt, that I might haue carried thy heauy Croſſe?</p>
                     <p>Oh, how happily ſhould I haue ſhut vp the laſt euening of my ſhort and gloomy dayes?</p>
                     <p>Oh how bleſſedly ſhould I haue finiſhed my <hi>reſtles courſe,</hi> if I had died with thee on thy ſacred <hi>croſſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh how ſweet had the ſharpe deadly <hi>pangs</hi> and dolorous paines beene vnto mee, how ioyfull had dolefull <hi>death</hi> bene vnto me a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull ſinner, if I had died with

                     </p>

                     <p>Firſt, hauing exiled all compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and pittie from their heart, they lay hold vpon him with their bloudie and polluted hands, and then they haſtily rob and diſroabe him of his garments, before a rude multitude of the baſeſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the people, yea, they ſtrip him ſtarke naked, that hee might appeare more vile and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their eyes.</p>

                     <p>Thou wert poore indeed at thy birth, but now thou art more poore at thy death: for at thy birth thou hadſt a Stable for thy Chamber, and a Manger for thy Cradle: thou hadſt ſwathling cloathes (although they vvere courſe) that might defend thee from colde, and cheriſh thy tender body.

                     <p>But ſuch, oh ſuch, and ſo vile is the horrible ingratitude of my minde; ſuch, and ſo great, is the dulneſſe of my memorie, ſuch and ſo hard, is the <hi>ſtupiditie</hi> of my hart, that I am vnthankfull for thy mercy, forgetfull of thy bounty, ſenſeleſſe without any compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea quite colde, without any zealous meditation of thy grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Haue mercy vpon mee, oh my moſt mercifull Lord, haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vpon mee, Oh let the ſweet dew of thy infinite mercie, diſtill

Alas mine eyes are dry without <hi>teares,</hi> my kinde Ieſu, my <hi>heart</hi> is ſo dead, that it cannot breath forth any heauie groanes: mine affections are ſtarke colde, without any heate of true deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo often, yea rather ſo ſeldom, as I enter into a meditation of thy bitter Paſſion, and ruminate thy tedious paines and terrible <hi>pangs</hi> vvhich thou didſt feele in thy

                     <p>But pardon me, forgiue me my moſt mercifull Lord, I haue a hart of Iron, my bowels are more hard then Marble, vnleſſe thou mollifie them, they are vnapt to receiue any print of thy mercie, or any impreſſion of thy grace.</p>
                     <p>Take away from mee I pray thee my ſtonie heart, giue mee a fleſhie and tender heart, that may be vvounded vvith the thornes of ſorrowe for my rebellious thoughts, yeeld forth dolefull groanes for my grieuous ſins, and bleed vvith the vvounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, when my minde doth meditate on thy heauy Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Oh why ſhould not my heart, my vvretched heart, be pinched with ſome paine for the loue of

Wherefore haue the <hi>ſparks</hi> of my loue lien ſo long couered in the <hi>embers?</hi> Or rather why are they almoſt extinguiſhed? Oh what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere puniſhment ſhould I take of my ſelfe, for my monſtrous <hi>ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude?</hi> How is my tongue able to vtter one word, yea one ſillable of a word, to excuſe the coldneſſe of my loue? How may I bluſh, nay how may my face be confounded with ſhame vvhich am ſo vvay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and vnwilling to ſuffer any little affliction for thy ſake, who endured ſo many extreame tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for my <hi>ſinne?</hi> I lie on fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beds, couered vvarme vvith cloathes, and thou didſt lie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, nailed to a woodden Croſſe, and that in the time of colde wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vvhen others doe vvarme themſelues at a fire.</p>
                     <p>If my head begin to ake, I lay

                     <p>When I am ſicke, my friends about mee beſtirre themſelues to eaſe my diſeaſed body, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue my fainting ſpirits. But alas (my ſweet Sauiour) there vvas none about thee at the houre of thy pittifull and painefull death, vvhich vvould proffer thee any kinde deede, no, not ſo much as a comfortable word.</p>
                     <p>They offer thee bitter vvine mixed with mirrhe, and mingled with Gall. But although thy thirſt was great, cauſed by the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thy paines, and immoderate effuſion of thy blood, yet vvhen thou hadſt taſted of it, thou didſt

                     <p>How hard were their harts? yea how dead, without any feeling of common compaſſion, that could giue vnto my ſweet Sauiour no better then ſuch a bitter Potion?</p>
                     <p>Such was the ſuccour that they would afford thee at the houre of thy death: This was the beſt <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall</hi> they would giue thee a little before the parting of thy breath.</p>
                     <p>What iuſt occaſion hadſt thou my mercifull Redeemer? yea, what admirable patience hadſt thou, that thou didſt not bitterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh againſt the bloudie Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and vnbeleeuing Iewes, who were ſo maliciouſly madded, and bloudily minded againſt thee, that all vvhich they ſought, and all which they wrought, was to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thy ſorrow?</p>
                     <p>But whilſt their hearts were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with malice againſt thee,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:19321:143"/> and their hands labouring to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie thee, thou wert ſo farre from accuſing them for their ſauadge cruelty, that thou didſt pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heauenly Father, that hee would remit and forgiue their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſaying: <hi>Father pardon them, becauſe they know not what they doe.</hi> Luk. 23.34.</p>
                     <p>And this oh my ſweet Chriſt, vvas the firſt vvords vvhich thou ſpakeſt vpon thy bitter Croſſe: Indeede they knew thee not, for their eyes were blinded that they could not ſee, and their hearts were hardned that they could not vnderſtand.</p>
                     <p>Heere maiſt thou meditate (oh my ſoule) with exceeding comfort vpon the wonderfull patience, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable mercy, &amp; ſweet words of thy louing Sauiour, who was not ſo much grieued with paine of his owne <hi>afflictions,</hi> as hee was earneſt to pray for the remiſſion of their

Hee did not once open his mouth, to make any iuſt <hi>Apologie,</hi> for his owne innocencie, nor to denounce any deſerued maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: No, not one bitter vvord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, for their dogged cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. But in the extremeſt pangs of his bitter Paſſion, his tender heart was moued vvith pittifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards them, he opened the fountaine of his mercy, that the ſweet ſtreames of his <hi>Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> might flow vpon them.

                     <p>How ſhould my feeble tongue, like a trumpet (oh my bountifull Ieſu) ſound forth the wonderfull worthineſſe of thy ſurmounting mercy? How ſhould mine vnable and barren hart, conceiue the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie

                     <p>How affable and ineffable is the ſweetneſſe of thy charitable pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? how bottomleſſe is the depth of thy clemencie? how vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible is the treaſure of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie?</p>
                     <p>How large and ſpacious, yea how infinit are the bounds of thy mercie?

                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:19321:144"/>
                     <p>Thou wert not diſcouraged by their iniuries, thou wert not hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with their reproches: thou didſt not rebuke them for their euill words: thou didſt not check them for their wicked deeds: thou didſt ſeeke to ſalue their ſoares, who gaue thee deadly wounds: thou diddeſt make <hi>interceſſion</hi> for their life, who cruelly put thee to death: thou wert full of pitty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, whoſe hearts were empty of all compaſſion towards thee. Oh with what wonderfull mildnes of mind, with what great deuotion of ſpirit, in what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of loue didſt thou cry, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forgiue them?</hi> Oh wonderfull worke of thy worthy mercy! oh rare and memorable example of exceeding pitty! oh perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of excellent charity! oh let me poore wretched ſinner, taſte the ſweetnes of this hony, reuiue my dying heart with this cordiall

                     <p>For in truth, I know not what I do: loue of the world hath blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mine eyes, deſire of carnall pleaſures, is rooted in my heart, and all manner of <hi>wanton vanities</hi> are rife in my minde: I runne headlong in the broad way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: I cannot finde the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row path, which leadeth to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                     <p>Open mine eyes (oh Lord) that I may ſee to walke in thy wayes, and direct my feet, that I may tread in thy pathes.</p>
                     <p>Teach mee to follow the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of thy excellent patience, ſo that I may not wiſh well onely to my deareſt friends, which dearely

                     <p>But alas, how ſoone am I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed? how long is it before I will forgiue, if I be once offended?

I oftentimes fall out with my friend for a croſſe word, ſo that oftentimes in requitall, I ſeeke to doe him a miſchieuous deed: I thinke my ſelfe the worſe when I ſee him: Oh how doe I diſdaine to ſpeake vnto him?</p>
                     <p>Teach mee to learne this hard leſſon of patience: purge the ſeed of malice out of my mind, mellow the ground of my heart vvith the deaw of thy graces, that it may not onely be tender, to giue my beloued poore Friends, but that it may alſo be pliable to forgiue my

                     <p>My eye is too dimme, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the beauty, my eare is too dull, to heare the greatneſſe, my hart is too groſſe, to conceiue the goodnes, my taſte is too weake, to relliſh the ſweetnes, my tongue is

                     <p>Oh who can worthily eſtimate the dignitie of the gift? who can ſufficiently extol the bounty of the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:19321:153"/> giuer? although (my ſweet Ieſu) thy whole life was the merit of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, yet at thy bitter death thou didſt pay the full price of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Oh happy theefe that had ſuch a ſweet taſt of thy mercy! Oh bleſſed ſoule, that wert made partaker of ſuch infinite bounty! Oh what great graces &amp; excellent vertues were infuſed into thee, that thou didſt beleeue my Ieſus to be the true Son of God thy Creator: whom thou didſt ſee to die the death of a miſerable creature?</p>
                     <p>As thy faults were intollerable in thy diſſolute life, ſo thy faith appeareth admirable at thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull death. For what but faith was the motiue to moue thee to ſue to him to be remembred in his kingdome of eternall felicity, who to thy outward eyes appeared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a ſpectacle of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miſery? and as thy confidence was great, and thy loue much,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:19321:154"/> ſo thy Ieſus doth ſpeedily aſſure thee to enioy a bountifull reward.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I pray thee my moſt bountifull Ieſu, ſo to inſpire my minde with thy grace, and ſo to kindle thy loue in my breſt, that I may be contented to be crucified with thee here vpon earth, that I may be receiued by thee into thy kingdome of heauen.</p>
                     <p>And grant that I may ſo truly lament for my treſpaſſes, and ſhed ſuch bitter teares for my ſins that I may faithfully ſay with this peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent theefe: <hi>Lord remember mee when thou ſhalt come into thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> For I confeſſe O Lord, I haue beene no better then a Theefe, for I haue robbed thee of thy honor, I haue bene vntrue vnto thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thy glory.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:19321:156"/> good occaſion to mourne for his cruell death.</p>
                     <p>For though no doubt ſhe was annointed with oyle of graces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue her fellowes, yet we may not thinke ſhee vvas quite exempted from the paſſions of a woman, or void of the tender affections of a Mother, when ſhee ſaw the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe head of her louing and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Son bleeding with a <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>Thornes,</hi> &amp; his innocent hands, and bleſſed feete, faſtened to the Croſſe with iron nailes.</p>
                     <p>Certainely ſhee knew that his Conception vvas ſo ſanctified by the holy Ghoſt in her wombe, that his moſt bleſſed body vvas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies free from the infection of impiety, and his fleſh neuer tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvith the corruption of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</p>
                     <p>But yet ſhee knew hee did not ſuffer without ſenſe of his paines, and although he was endued with
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:19321:157"/> a ſupernaturall patience, yet ſhee knew that he felt the pangs of his bitter Paſſion, ſubiect by his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature to many infirmities as we are: yet euer hauing a pure heart and cleane hands, from the ſpots of ſinne, vvherewith our ſoules are polluted, &amp; our bodies continually infected.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore thinke oh my ſoule, that as her afflictions were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, ſo her lamentation vvas great: ſuppoſe that thou doeſt ſee her, with her face diſcolored with paleneſſe, diſcouering her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly ſorrow to thy outward eies, and that thou didſt heare her mournefull tongue, telling this dolefull tale to thy attentiue eares, vvhich ſhould cauſe thee to be a partner with her in her woe, and ſigh for thy ſinnes, which vvere the cauſe of her ſorrow, to ſee her beloued Sonne ſo cruelly crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gentiles, and ſo diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:19321:157"/> derided by the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>Thinke (I ſay) that thou doeſt ſee her vvatering her eyes vvith ſtore of teares &amp; vttering theſe or the like words, with her ſorrowfull lips to her dearely beloued Son, (which words ſhould draw out teares from thine eyes, and driue out groanes from thy hart) which ſhee pronounced with a dolefull accent in this or the like manner.</p>
                     <p>Oh what medicine, (be it neuer ſo soueraigne) can aſſwage the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of my malady? what ſalue (be it neuer ſo precious) can heale the wounds of my bleeding heart? vvhat vvords (be they neuer ſo comfortable) can cheare vp my dolefull minde, when I ſee thee my beloued Sonne, ſo cruelly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and ſo ignominiouſly taunted? Alas for me poore wretch thy ſorrowfull Mother.</p>
                     <p>How intollerable is the paine? how grieuous is the puniſhment
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:19321:158"/> that is inflicted vpon thee? Thy death is not ſo bitter vnto mee, (and yet how loath I am to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe thee,) as theſe cruell torments which I ſee, doe torture thy inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent body, and doe greatly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſorrow of my perplexed minde. As thy bleſſed life was the cauſe of my chiefeſt felicity, ſo will thy bitter death be the beginning of my miſerie.</p>
                     <p>Who ſhall afford mee comfort in the time of my calamity? who ſhall giue me counſell? who ſhall be my ſuccour in the time of my neceſſitie, vvhen I am ſeparated from thee? How ſhall I ſpend the daies with ſorrowing, and paſſe through the teadious nights with mourning?</p>
                     <p>But thou oh my GOD om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, vvhich art his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father, vvho canſt not ſhut thine eies of compaſſion from thine afflicted Sonne, comfort
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:19321:158"/> mee his ſorrowfull Mother.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſeeſt the wounds of his body, thou knoweſt the ſorrowes of my heart, and becauſe thou art a Father of mercies, and a GOD of all conſolation, looke downe vpon me out of thy holy Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, and as thou haſt proued me to be thy faithfull Handmaide, ſo let the ſweetneſſe of thy Fatherly loue, temper the bitterneſſe of my griefe, that although I be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the humane ſocietie of my Sonne, yet the vvings of thy prouidence, may ſtill ouerſhadow mee, and thy omnipotent arme ſafely protect me.</p>
                     <p>But as the Virgine <hi>Marie</hi> did bewaile the cruell and bloudie death of her innocent Sonne, ſo <hi>Marie Magdalene,</hi> vvith many teares guſhing out of her eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to lament the wofull caſe of him her louing Maſter, on this or ſuch like manner.</p>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:19321:159"/>
                     <p>Oh my deere Maſter! oh my gracious Lord! oh my bleſſed and bountifull benefactor! I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue without thy louing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: I cannot abide, without thy amiable Societie: What tongue, though it ſpeake neuer ſo dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, can truly relate my ſorrow? What vvords, be they neuer ſo rhetoricall, can eaſe my inward griefe, vvhen I ſee I ſhall be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from ſo louing and ſo kinde a Maſter?</p>
                     <p>Oh how tyrannous are the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith the bloudy tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors doe torment thine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted body? How ſharpe are the arrowes of their malice, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they vvound thy righteous ſoule? How grieuous is the ſight of their cruell deedes vnto mine eyes? How odious are their dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged words vnto mine eares? Yet my conſtant loue vnto thee, will not giue mee leaue to leaue thee,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:19321:159"/> (though it be a death vnto mee to ſee thy calamity) ſo long as mine eyes may behold thee.</p>
                     <p>The ſight of the bitter <hi>pangs</hi> of thy Paſſion doth affright me with horrour: The ſignes of thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death, doth confound my ſenſes with continuall <hi>terror:</hi> I ſee thy head which I annointed with pretious oyntment, cruelly pierced with Thornes, &amp; pittifully bleedihg with many wounds.</p>
                     <p>I ſee thy harmleſſe hands pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with iron nayles, and thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent feete ſtained vvith bloud, which I bathed with the teares of mine eyes, and vviped vvith the haire of my head.</p>
                     <p>Oh how ſhould I ſufficiently bewaile the innocent death of my louing Ieſus?</p>
                     <p>How doth my heart faint with ſorrow, and my ſenſes faile me for griefe, when I ſee the torments of his body, and when I thinke

                     <p>Now thou haſt heard (my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull ſoule) the lamentation of the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> as a kinde Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſorrowing for the death of her deareſt Sonne: and the pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mourning of <hi>Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> ſighing for the loſſe of ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and kinde a Maſter; Ceaſe not thou to ſhed teares, with thy weeping eyes, and to ſob vvith a broken and contrite heart, for the cruell and ſhamefull death of thy louing Sauiour, who died for thy hainous ſinnes, and ſuffered for thy horrible tranſgreſſions.</p>
                     <p>Grant me, oh my moſt gratious Lord, that my head may flowe with water, and that mine eyes may be turned into a fountaine of teares: For vvhere ſhall I goe to

                     <p>NOw call to minde my ſinfull ſoule, how the firmament was darkened, the Sunne eclipſed, and his beames obſcured at the bitter Paſſion of thy Sauiour. And mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile not that the brightneſſe of the Sunne vvas dimmed, and that his golden beames, did not ſhew forth their glorie, vvhen as the

                     <p>But meditate not onely oh my ſoule, on the horrible cruelty of the barbarous Gentiles, and on the execrable ſpite of the bloudy Iewes, and that their facts vvere ſo odious, and their deedes ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, that they ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue

How grieuous were the afflictions that preſſed and perplexed thy minde, groaning vnder the heauie burden of our ſinnes, impoſed vpon thine inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſhoulders? Indeede our hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinnes, our horrible tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, moued falſe-hearted <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> to betray thee, and induced the ſtubborne-minded Iewes to reiect thee: they made thy Diſciples to flye for feare, and to leaue their louing Maſter in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: they compelled thy head to bee crowned vvith pricking thornes, thy face to be defiled with ſpettle, thy body to be ſcourged
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:19321:164"/> with vvhippes: they pierced thy hands, and nailed thy feete, they were the hammer and nailes that faſtned thee to the Croſſe.

But as thy outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were vnſpeakeable, ſo thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſorrow was more intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vvhen thou didſt thinke how forgetfull vvee vvould be of thy mercies, and how vnthankfull we would be for thy benefits.</p>
                     <p>And as thou, my moſt deare Ieſu, in the fierceſt fittes of thine agonie, and ſoreſt pangs of thy Paſſion, didſt call, and crie to thy heauenly Father for ſuccour, ſo teach mee to lift vp my deuout heart, pure hands, and a lowde voice, towards the ſeat of mercy, when any outward affliction doth pinch my body, or any inward tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation preſſe my ſoule: teach me oh Lord in the ſtormie daies of my greateſt perſecutions, to meditate on thy vvonted good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and when my ſoule is moſt perplexed with the horror of my guilty conſcience, to thinke on
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:19321:165" rendition="simple:additions"/> the multitude of thy mercies.</p>
                     <p>But forſake mee not, my ſweet Ieſu, vvhen my ſtrength faileth: vphold mee when my feete begin to ſlide, and raiſe mee vp vvhen I begin to fall: thou doeſt neuer leaue them vvithout comfort in time of their trouble, vvho come vnto thee vvith confidence of thy promiſes, and faithfully craue thy ſuccour: Oh ſuffer not my ſoule to be caſt downe vvith immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate mourning, or my mouth to be filled vvith murmuring, when thy hand lieth heauie vpon mee. Comfort my drouping heart with ſome taſte of thy heauenly conſolation, vvhen either the ſword of <hi>perſecution</hi> doth vvound my body, or ſorrow for my ſinnes doth afflict my minde.

Let me remember, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the Father of the faithfull, was often afflicted: that <hi>Iacob</hi> thy beloued, was conſtrained to flye for feare of <hi>Eſau,</hi> his rough-handed, and hard-harted brother, and then vngently intreated, and vniuſtly rewarded for his faithfull ſeruice, by <hi>Laban</hi> his churliſh Vnckle. That <hi>Dauid</hi> thy choſen vvas often in danger of his life, purſued and perſecuted by furious <hi>Saul,</hi> before he was aduanced to his Kingdome. Oh let mee not forget the many miſeries, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter afflictions, which tumbled in heapes vpon <hi>Iob</hi> thy faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant:
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:19321:166" rendition="simple:additions"/> Let their patience calme the turbulent motions of my repining minde, and let the remembrance of their deliuerance arme my hart with a confident and ſtedfaſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that the eye of thy carefull prouidence neuer ſleepeth nor ſlumbreth, but continually watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ouer thy faithfull and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that thine omnipotent arme is then ſtretched out to rid them out of perill, vvhen they ſeeme to be in a deſperate caſe, paſt all hope, and fartheſt from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
                     <p>And let me know that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the beſt hope that thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may expect in this worldly Lotterie, but yet let the anchor of my hope take ſuch ſure hold on thy promiſes in the time of my miſery, that I may alwaies be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that thou art able, and neuer vnwilling to cure my <hi>maladie,</hi> if I call faithfully vpon thy name, and

Thou doſt not thirſt ſo much for wine which is preſſed out of the grapes of the Vine: or for water which floweth out of the Riuer: but thy thirſt is my ſaluation, thy meat is my redemption. Thou doeſt thirſt for my faith, my ſaluation, my ioy: this ſpirituall thirſt did more affect thy ſoule, then any naturall or humane thirſt could afflict thy body: Therefore thirſt thou (oh my ſoule after thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and merciful Sauiour) as the <hi>thirſty Hart deſireth the water.</hi> Oh how canſt thou but thirſt after him, who hath thirſteth ſo much after thee?

                     <p>Grant me my Lord, that I may offer vnto thee the wine of my true deuotion, vvith the Mirrhe of mortification, and gall of hearty contrition. But as it might be dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto thee my ſoule, to heare thy louing Ieſus cry out, <hi>Sitio, I thirſt:</hi> ſo let it be ioyfull vnto thee, to heare him take his farewel with <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> It is finiſhed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.30. Oh let the Meditation of this word be more ſweet vnto me, then the hony vvhich <hi>Sampſon</hi> found in the carkaſſe of the Lyon, vvhen he was hungry, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14 8. and more delectable vnto mee,

                     <p>Now he had cancelled the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of my infinite debt, and not vvith ſiluer and gold, but with his owne moſt pretious blood purchaſed my Redemption: And by his death, conquered death, hell and the deuill.</p>
                     <p>Oh happy death that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed mee to eternall life! Oh glorious victory, although my Sauiour obtained it ſo dearely!

                     <p>Direct my ſpirit, oh Lord, by the leuell of thy perfect word: let the meditation of my heart be day and night in thy ſacred law, that I may offer vp vnto thee daily the calues of my vnfained lippes, ſpeaking of thy meruailous kindneſſe early in the morning, and telling of thy manifold mercies late in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: ſend downe a gratious raine of thy holy Spirit into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of my heart, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of thine innumerable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, may perpetually flouriſh in my minde, and thine euerlaſting praiſes euermore ſound in my mouth, for thou alone art my Redeemer, oh Lord God of my ſaluation.</p>

                     <p>But before thou paſſe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (oh my ſoule) doe thou not let it paſſe without earneſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, how that although the hearts of the tormentors of mine afflicted Ieſus, were ſo poyſoned with impietie, and their hands ſo polluted with cruelty, that they grieued his righteous ſoule vvith their ſcornes and reproaches: kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his innocent body with their tortures, yet that the fury of their malicious harts was ſo reſtrained, and the violence of their cruell hands ſo repreſſed, that they
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19321:178"/> could not breake one bone of his bleſſed body, as they did of the malefactors, which were crucified with him, becauſe the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ſaid they ſhould not, and therefore their hands were fettered that they could not: <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. <hi>Num.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. Wherefore let this meditation comfort thy drooping heart (oh my ſoule) and conſolate thy fainting ſpirits in the ſowreſt fits of any worldly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and in the ſoreſt conflicts of any affliction that can betide thee: that no Tyrant, be hee neuer ſo mighty, or his heart neuer ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, can imagine more in his cruell thoughts, or act any more with his bloudy hands againſt thee, then the Diuine prouidence hath predeſtinated, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the higheſt hath alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
                     <p>Let this reſolution be as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Balme to heale the wounds

                     <p>Oh who is able to relate the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, to expreſſe the ſorrow, and vtter the griefe of the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> mourning for the death of her deare Sonne, and other vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, vvho did behold him vvith their compaſſionate eyes, vvhen (like an innocent Lambe) he gaue vp the Ghoſt, and bewailed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from them, vvith floods of teares!</p>
                     <p>Now thinke that thou doeſt heare the Virgine <hi>Marie</hi> diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the inward ſorrowes of her heart, (of her grieued and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded heart) vttered out of her dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mouth, paſſionate, as ſhe was a tender harted woman, and more compaſſionate, as ſhee vvas a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Mother, vvhen ſhee ſaw the vvounded and breathleſſe body of her Sonne, taken downe from the Croſſe.</p>

                     <p>Oh my moſt ſweet Sonne, what is my felicity, which I had by thee in thy life? Is it any thing elſe but extreame miſerie at thy death? how is my chiefeſt ioy changed into ſorrow? my mirth into mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? how is my reioycing turned into lamenting, my cheerefulneſſe turned into heauineſſe? nothing can mittigate my calamity, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can eaſe my malady.</p>
                     <p>What hadſt thou done (oh my moſt deare Sonne) what hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime hadſt thou commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? vvhat odious treaſon hadſt thou perpetrated, that thou wert condemned to die ſuch a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and bitter death?</p>
                     <p>Thy pure hands were neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with any euill actions: and thy harmleſſe heart did neuer har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

Oh how bitter was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice? how horrible was the enuie? how blinde were the eyes? how bloody were the hearts of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Iewes, to crucifie my deare Sonne, my innocent Ieſus? how dolefull is it to mine eyes, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous to my heart, to behold thy bright eyes obſcured with deadly darkneſſe! thy bleſſed hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of action, and thy beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feete ſenſleſſe vvithout any motion! to ſee thy cheerefull countenance couered with an aſhy paleneſſe, thy skinne blacke and

                     <p>This ſpectacle is ſo wofull, that I can no longer behold thee with mine eyes, and the waues of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row doe ouerflow my heart ſo faſt, that they ſtop my words, and ſtay the current of my mournfull ſpeech.</p>

Thou art hee which diddeſt often vouchſafe to come into my cottage, and to ſit downe at my Table, and didſt vouchſafe to honour my poore houſe with thy gratious preſence, when alas I was not able to afford thee any ſuch entertainement as might in any ſort requite thy kindeneſſe, or recompence thy loue, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.28.

                     <p>Oh what great, and how many demonſtrations of thy loue, how many tokens of thy kindneſſe, how many ſignes of thy charity, how many arguments of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Oh my moſt ſweet Lord, haſt thou ſhewed vnto mee? vvhat a

As nothing was more ſweet and pleaſant vnto me, then to enioy thy bleſſed compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſo nothing can be more ſowre and ſharpe vnto me, then want of thy comfortable ſocietie.</p>
                     <p>But alas, ſorrowfull words are too weake a medicine to cure my maladie: and although I haue
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:19321:185"/> cauſe to ſay much, yet extreamity of griefe vvill ſuffer mee to ſay no more.</p>
                     <p>Now thou haſt heard oh my ſoule, the lamentation of a tender Mother, deploring the death of her Sonne, and alſo the pittifull mourning of a faithfull ſeruant, bewayling the want of him, who was her louing Maſter, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull benefactor: canſt thou be ſo ſtonie-hearted, that thou art mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with no feeling compaſſion?

                     <p>What ſhall I ſay, but woe and alas for me, a moſt wretched and wicked ſinner? Who can meaſure the quantity of mine infelicitie? Who can deſcribe the horrour of my miſerie?

How can I excuſe the coldneſſe of my loue? How ſhould I cleare my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull minde? If Death take away my Father, or depriue me of my Mother, I water my cheekes vvith teares, and vvearie my heart vvith groaning. I can weepe for the death of a Brother, and wring my hands for ſorrow at the buriall

                     <p>But alas, how is the moiſture of mine eyes conſumed, that they cannot yeeld one teare? How ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate is my heart that it will not groane when I think on the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pangs of my Sauiour, and when I meditate on the grieuous paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bitter death of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, who hath beene more beneficiall vnto mee then any lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Father! and more kinde then any tender-hearted mother: what kindneſſe of a Brother, or milde affection of a Siſter, can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall his loue? What friend can be ſo glad for my proſperitie? who of mine acquaintance can be ſo ſad for my aduerſitie? Who can

By the Vnderſtanding, I view and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template what God is in himſelfe, what hee is in the Angels, what
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19321:192"/> he is in the Saints, what hee is in Men, what he is in the Creatures. In himſelfe, hee is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, becauſe he is the beginning and end, and the beginning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, the end without end. By my ſelfe, I vnderſtand how incomprehenſible God is, when as I cannot know, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand my ſelfe, whom he hath made. In the Angels he is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe they deſire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him. In the Saints hee is delectable, becauſe being happy in him, they reioyce continually, in other creatures hee is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe he createth all things powerfully; gouerneth all things wiſely, diſpoſeth all things bountifully. In men hee is ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe he is their GOD, and they are his people. Hee dwelleth in them, euen as in his <hi>Temple,</hi> and they are his <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Hee diſdaineth neyther

Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is mindefull of him, and doth both know, and alſo loue him,<note place="margin">Motiues to moue vs to loue God.</note> hee is vvith him. Wee ought to loue him, becauſe hee hath firſt loued vs, and hath made vs after his Image and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, which thing he would not impart to any other creature. Wee are made according to the Image of GOD, that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vnderſtanding, and knowledge of the Sonne, by whom we vnderſtand, and know the Father, and haue acceſſe vnto him.</p>
                     <p>So great is the affinitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and the Sonne of God, as that wee are the image of him, who is the image of God. Which affinitie alſo, the ſimilitude doth teſtifie: becauſe wee are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made according to his ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but alſo to his likeneſſe. Therefore it behoueth, that that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19321:193"/> which is made according to his image, doe agree vvith his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and not participate one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a vaine name of the Image. In vvhich regard, let vs repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and expreſſe his Image in our ſelues, in the feruent deſire of peace, in the beholding of truth, and in the loue of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
                     <p>Let vs holde him in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, let vs carrie him in our conſcience, and let vs adore and vvorſhip him euery where, vvho is preſent euery where.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19321:194"/> Therefore why doe wee forſake our ſelues and ſeeke God in theſe externall and outward things, who is at home with vs, if vvee will be with him?</p>
                     <p>Verely hee with vs, and in vs, but as yet by faith, vntill vvee ſhall ſee him face to face. <hi>Wee know</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by faith.</hi>

                     <p>What am I?

                     <p>Euen ſo, oh heauenly Father, let the cup of <hi>Babilon</hi> be bitter vnto me, let not the pleaſant colour of the wine allure me to taſte of that poyſoned liquor, neither let the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful ſweetnes of it ouercome my vnderſtanding, nor drowne my reaſon, as it hath done theirs, which thinke darknes to be light, and light to be darkenes, bitter to be ſweet, &amp; ſweet to be bitter. I dare not drinke of the wine tempered with Mirrhe, and mixed with gall, becauſe thou wouldeſt not drinke of it, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15.23. For thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the bitterneſſe of the enuy and malice which thy furious Foes did beare againſt thee, who would afforde thee no humane

Faſhion thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, oh Lord, like vnto thy quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning death, that according to the fleſh I may die daily, crucifying my carnall luſts, alwayes loathing the thing that is euill, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit, I may daily be reuiued, imbracing and louing the thing that is righteous and good. And that I may reioyce to carry in me the perfect Image of thee my Lord and crucified Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, expreſſe alſo a ſimilitude of that in mee, which the vnſaciable crueltie of the euill ones acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, after thy curſed and yet moſt bleſſed death: Let thy liuely and powerfull Word pierce into my ſide, and wound my hart: For thy word, oh Lord, will ſooner enter then a double-edged ſword, and penetrate deeper then the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt ſpeare, euen to the diuiſion of

So that as thou haſt not ſpared to ſhed thy heart bloud for me, I may alwayes be willing to expreſſe my gratuitie towards thee.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, wrap my Spirit in the pure linnen cloth of thy righteous garment, in which I may ſafely reſt, comming out, and going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of thy holy Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and wherewith thou mayeſt hide mee vntill thine anger be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and thy heauy diſpleaſure remoued. But the third day, after the day of labour and puniſhment, earely in the dawning of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, raiſe mee euerlaſtingly amongſt thy children, that in my fleſh I may ſee thy brightnes, and be filled with the ioy of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>

But praiſe thou, oh my Soule, my God my Sauiour, and magnifie his Name. For it is holy, repleniſhed with ſtore of moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, whoſe quantitie is ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with no meaſure, nor qualitie ſubiect to any mutability.</p>

Oh Ieſus, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of thoſe which were loſt, the Sauiour of thoſe which are redeemed, the hope of the bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the ſtrength of thoſe that are troubled, the libertie of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit afflicted with bondage, the comfortable ſolace, and ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of a ſorrowfull Soule, which ſheddeth teares, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forth ſweat, while it runneth after thee; the Crowne of the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing, the onely reward and ioy of all celeſtiall Citizens, the moſt plentifull Fountaine of all Graces, the glorious Sonne of the higheſt God, and alſo the higheſt God, <hi>Roman.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.7.9.
